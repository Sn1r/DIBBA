# Damn Insecure Building Blocks Application (DIBBA)

DIBBA is an intentionally vulnerable Android application that adds a fun way of learning the core concepts of Android building blocks. Each activity not only explains a specific Android component but also presents a corresponding vulnerability to test your skills. Designed for Android developers and pentesters, DIBBA provides an interactive platform to grasp and practice fundamental Android concepts in a unique way.

## Notes
* The challenges themselves aren't meant to be overly difficult, as they are mainly focused on the learning process
* Each challenge comes with its own flag, which you'll receive upon completion
* Although the app is all about exploring the fundamental components, you'll sometimes need to dive into the source code for certain challenges

## Installation

You can compile the application from source or download it straight from release.
